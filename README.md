4. Enhance Security:
Use environment variables to store sensitive data like API keys.
Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
Add CORS policies to your server so that only your extension can make requests to it.
By following these steps, you can ensure that your API keys stay hidden and secured while still allowing your extension to access the capabilities of the OpenAI API.
